# Business Insights & Recommendations

## 1. Customer Segmentation Summary

Three distinct customer segments were identified:

### Cluster 1 — Champions
- Most recent buyers
- High purchase frequency
- Highest monetary value

**Business Value:**
These customers generate a disproportionate share of revenue
and should be protected from churn.

---

### Cluster 2 — Potential Loyalists
- Moderate recency
- Moderate frequency and spending

**Business Value:**
This segment represents the strongest growth opportunity.

---

### Cluster 0 — Hibernating Customers
- Long time since last purchase
- Low engagement and spending

**Business Value:**
Low immediate ROI, but suitable for reactivation campaigns.

---

## 2. Temporal Behavior Insights

### Hour of Day
Across all clusters:
- Peak activity consistently occurs between **12:00–14:00**
- Early morning and evening activity is minimal

**Implication:**
Promotional messages should be scheduled around lunchtime
for maximum visibility.

---

### Day of Week
- **Thursday and mid-week days dominate activity**
- Weekend activity is significantly lower
- Saturday engagement is minimal

**Implication:**
Mid-week campaigns outperform weekend promotions.

---

### Month Period
Customer activity is relatively balanced between:
- Early
- Mid
- Late month

However:
- Champions show slightly stronger engagement early in the month
- Hibernating customers show no strong monthly preference

**Implication:**
- Loyalty and VIP offers perform best early-month
- Reactivation discounts can be distributed more evenly

## Final Note
This analysis demonstrates how combining **behavioral segmentation**
with **temporal patterns** enables smarter, more cost-effective
marketing decisions.

the business can now answer:

> **Who should we target, and when should we reach them?**
